TODO:
 - rework the states in WorkHist and Edu to create an object when saved instead of holding all of the information in state, since you can't add multiple jobs/schools that way. Realistically, I am unlikely to refactor WorkHist any time soon because nesting that many arrays in states sounds miserable when it wasn't built with that in mind, and the proof-of-concept (nesting components and passing data, including callback functions, between them) can be seen in the other list outputs.
 
  ***(UPDATE 10/13: Edu reworked, multiple schools can be added)
